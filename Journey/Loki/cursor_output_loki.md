Based on the logs you've provided, there doesn't seem to be an explicit error preventing connection to Loki. However, there are a few potential issues that might be affecting your ability to connect from Grafana:
DNS resolution problem:
There are repeated warnings about failing to resolve the loki-memberlist hostname:
loki_logs.md
ts=2024-10-21T16:19:46.382833572Z caller=memberlist_logger.go:74 level=warn msg="Failed to resolve loki-memberlist: lookup loki-memberlist on 10.96.0.10:53: no such host"
This issue persists throughout the log, which might indicate a problem with DNS resolution in your Kubernetes cluster.
Network configuration:
Loki is listening on the following addresses:
loki_logs.md
level=info ts=2024-10-21T16:19:46.359049513Z caller=server.go:288 http=[::]:3100 grpc=[::]:9095 msg="server listening on addresses"
Ensure that Grafana is configured to connect to Loki on the correct address and port (likely 3100 for HTTP).
Service discovery:
If you're using Kubernetes service discovery in Grafana, make sure the Loki service is properly defined and labeled.
Firewall or network policies:
Check if there are any network policies or firewalls preventing communication between Grafana and Loki.
Loki readiness:
The logs show that Loki started successfully, but you might want to check if it's fully ready to accept connections.
To troubleshoot further:
1. Verify the Loki service is running and accessible within the cluster:
   kubectl get services -n loki
Try to connect to Loki from within the cluster using a temporary debug pod:
   kubectl run tmp-shell --rm -i --tty --image nicolaka/netshoot -- /bin/bash
   curl http://loki-service:3100/ready
Check Grafana's logs for any connection errors related to Loki.
Verify Grafana's data source configuration for Loki, ensuring the URL is correct.
If using Ingress, check the Ingress configuration for Loki.
Without more specific error messages from Grafana or your connection attempts, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact issue. These suggestions should help you investigate further.
